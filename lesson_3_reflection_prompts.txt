When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you need to access the repo remotely and when you have multiple users who needs access for commits!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be instances where you create content on the remote. 
    Then you want to pull the contents to your machine.
    Automatic commits could impact in many commits on a small number of chanes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a kind of inbuilt tool from Github to actually clone the content and link it back to the original
    Clone does exactly what it says and you are able to clone a remote repo or a local repo
    Branches are the once we make from the master for experimenting or for some other reason
