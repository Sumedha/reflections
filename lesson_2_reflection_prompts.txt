What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a .git hidden directory which would contain all your meta data

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging adds the files to the staging area and waits for changes to commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	When you add the file to the staging area and make the changes and commit it clears from the working area
	You can always do a git --staging to see whether you've made the correct number of commits

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	When you want to have a branch for experimental or a different language.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	As the commits are on a vertical line, you need to implement new branches
	New branches then are parallel to the master and easier to visualize when looking at the diagram!

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
